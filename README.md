# Snakeopoly

Snakeopoly is a cynical and educational take on the classic snake game, viewed through the lens of Google's ascent to an ever-growing monopoly. Developed in Golang, this game immerses players in a NOKIA-inspired digital playground where they navigate a snake, symbolizing Google, on its quest to collect *data points* and *special data points* â€”each representing Google's strategic acquisitions and milestones.

## Game Architecture

The Snakeopoly codebase is structured as follows:
- assets/: Contains game assets like fonts and images.
    - fonts/: Font files for UI rendering.
    - images/30x30/: Image files for game characters and elements.
    - assets.go: Manages asset loading and processing.
    - competitors.csv: Stores competitors data (Name, slug, year, text, and level).
- game/: Main game logic and components.
    - cfg.go: Configuration constants (screen dimensions, colors, fonts).
    - datapoint.go: DataPoint logic (game objectives).
    - game.go: Core game structure and game state management.
    - snake.go: Snake entity logic.
    - ui.go: UI rendering and management.
    - shapes.go: Contains 2D array shapes to draw pixelated shapes on screen.
- .gitignore
- go.mod, go.sum: Go module files for managing dependencies.
- main.go: Entry point of the game.


## Key Features

- **State Management** : Implements a snake game with a welcome state, play state, and game over state.
- **User Inputs** : Handles user inputs for game interactions.
- **Asset Management** : Manages game assets like images and fonts efficiently.
- **Blink Theme Feature** : Introduces a "Blink Theme" feature that toggles between DayTheme and NightTheme, ensuring the theme resets to the player's chosen theme after completion.
- **Performance Optimization** : Focuses on addressing performance issues and optimizing response time as the project grows.
